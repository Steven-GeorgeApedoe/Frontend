      A restaurant is a business that prepares and serves food
      and drinks to customers.[1] Meals are generally served and eaten on the premises,
      but many restaurants also offer take-out and food delivery services.
      Restaurants vary greatly in appearance and offerings, including a wide variety of cuisines
      and service models ranging from inexpensive fast-food restaurants and cafeterias to mid-priced
      family restaurants, to high-priced luxury establishments.

      <h2>What we serve</h2>
      Restaurants are classified or distinguished in many different ways.
      The primary factors are usually the food itself (e.g. vegetarian, seafood, steak);
      the cuisine (e.g. Italian, Korean, Chinese, Japanese, Indian, French, Mexican, Thai)
      or the style of offering (e.g. tapas bar, a sushi train, a tastet restaurant, a buffet restaurant
      or a yum cha restaurant). Beyond this, restaurants may differentiate themselves on factors
      including speed (see fast food), formality, location, cost, service, or novelty themes
      (such as automated restaurants). Some of these also include fine dining, casual dining,
      contemporary casual, family style, fast casual, fast food, cafes, buffet, concession stands,
      food trucks, pop-up restaurants, diners, and ghost restaurants.
